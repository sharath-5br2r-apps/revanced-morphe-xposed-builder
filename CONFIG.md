# Config

Adding another revanced app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
# or uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a patch name itself contains a single quote, double it inside the string (e.g. 'Hide ''Get Music Premium''').

## More about other options:

There exists an example below with all defaults shown and all the keys explicitly set.  
**All keys are optional** (except download urls) and are assigned to their default values if not set explicitly.  

```toml

remove-rv-integrations-checks = true # remove checks from the revanced integrations

cli-source-host = "github"                       # source host for cli: "github" or "gitlab". default: "github"
# options like cli-source can also set per app
rv-brand = "ReVanced Extended" # rebrand from 'ReVanced' to something different. default: patches-source owner

patches-version = "v2.160.0" # 'latest', 'dev', or a version number. default: "latest"

[Some-App]
app-name = "SomeApp" # if set, release name becomes SomeApp instead of Some-App. default is same as table name, which is 'Some-App' here.
pkg-name = "com.some.app" # explicit package name override. recommended to avoid unnecessary network checks when caching.
patch-folder = "someapp" # explicit patch folder name override. forces the CI to strictly match patches inside this exact folder name, bypassing fallback heuristics (useful for resolving collisions like youtube vs youtube-music). Supports multiple folders space-separated (e.g. "ad backup geo"), or a wildcard "*" to force mapping every single patch folder in the repo.

build-mode = "both"  # 'both', 'apk' or 'module'. default: apk

# 'auto' option gets the latest possible version supported by all the included patches
# 'exp' gets the latest experimental version from patches.json. falls back to 'latest' if none found.
# 'latest' gets the latest stable without checking patches support. 'beta' gets the latest beta/alpha
# whitespace seperated list of patches to exclude. default: ""
version = "auto"     # 'auto', 'exp', 'latest', 'beta' or a version number (e.g. '17.40.41'). default: auto
# target Android versionCode. 'auto' automatically resolves the supported versionCode from patch metadata (e.g. Morphe Desktop).
# can also be set to an explicit versionCode (e.g. '473623755') or mapped per-architecture ('arm64-v8a: 473623755 | arm-v7a: 473623748').

## Multiple Patch Sources

You can pass multiple patch bundles to the CLI by specifying `patches-source` as a quoted list (same format as `excluded-patches`).
When using multiple sources, the CLI merges the patch bundles. However, please see the **Current Limitations** below regarding `included-patches` and `excluded-patches`.

```toml
# single-line format
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"

# multiline format
patches-source = """\
  'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' \
  'other/patches' \
  """

# If all sources are on the same host, a single string applies to all:
patches-source-host = "github"

# If sources span different hosts, provide one value per source in order:
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"

# Same rule applies to patches-version:
patches-version = "latest"                        # applies to all sources
patches-version = "'latest' 'v1.2.3'"             # per-source versions
```

> [!TIP]
> **Per-bundle patch selection**: When using multiple sources, separate patch lists 
> with `|` to control each bundle independently:
> ```toml
> patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"
> excluded-patches = "'Patch A' | 'Patch B'"    # Patch A from bundle 1, Patch B from bundle 2
> included-patches = "'' | 'Patch X'"           # nothing from bundle 1, Patch X from bundle 2
> ```
> Without `|`, the same list applies to all bundles (backward compatible).

## Xposed Modules (NPatch / LSPatch)

You can natively inject Xposed modules into an app using `7723mod/NPatch` or `LSPatch` directly from your config. Simply set the `cli-source` to the NPatch repository and the `patches-source` to the Xposed module repository.

```toml
[Discord]
cli-source = "7723mod/NPatch"                            # Use NPatch as the CLI
cli-version = "latest"
patches-source = "revenge-mod/revenge-xposed"            # Provide the Xposed module as the patches bundle
patches-version = "latest"
version = "auto"                                         # 'auto' safely falls back to 'latest' since modules don't list supported versions
arch = "auto"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/discord/releases/..." # Or apkmirror, etc.
```

When the script detects `npatch` or `lspatch` in the CLI source, it will automatically bypass ReVanced CLI arguments and execute the correct injection command. You can also pass extra options to NPatch using `patcher-args = "-l 2"`.

## Instafel Patcher (Instagram Alpha)

You can natively build Instagram Alpha using the Instafel Patcher engine (`instafel/p-rel`) and Patcher Core (`instafel/pc-rel`).

```toml
[instagram-instafel]
cli-source = "instafel/p-rel"                            # Use Instafel Patcher CLI
cli-version = "latest"
patches-source = "instafel/pc-rel"                       # Provide Instafel Patcher Core
patches-version = "latest"
included-patches = "'unlock_developer_options' 'remove_snooze_warning' 'remove_ads' 'instafel'"
```

## Modular Configuration Directory

All configurations are now stored in the `.github/configs/patches/` directory for better maintainability.

- `config.toml`: Contains the global settings and base configurations.
- `*.stable.toml`: Configurations specifically merged into the `stable` build.
- `*.dev.toml`: Configurations specifically merged into the `dev` (pre-release) build.

Any configuration file in `.github/configs/patches/` that does **not** contain `stable` or `dev` in its filename is automatically included in **both** builds.

To add a new app, simply create or update a `.toml` file in `.github/configs/patches/`.

## Automatic App Version Checking

The CI workflow automatically detects when a new version of an app is released on APKMirror, Uptodown, or Archive.org.

### How it Works
1. **Version Fetching**: During the CI run, it reads all enabled apps from the `.github/configs/patches/*.toml` configurations and queries the URLs (`uptodown-dlurl`, `apkmirror-dlurl`, etc.).
2. **Comparison**: It checks the newly fetched versions against the currently stored versions in `.github/configs/app_versions.json`.
3. **Triggering**: If a new version is detected, the app is added to a temporary `active_apps.json` list, and the CI is triggered to build it.
### Tracking File
App versions are permanently tracked and committed to `.github/configs/app_versions.json`.
You can manually update this file if you need to force a specific version state, but the CI will automatically manage it during scheduled runs.

**Selective Checking:** If you only want the CI to check specific apps (instead of all enabled apps in your config), you can add `"_check_only_listed": true` to the top level of `app_versions.json`. When this is true, the script will only check for updates for the apps that already exist as keys in the file, saving time and resources.
