# Config

Adding another revanced app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
# or uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a patch name itself contains a single quote, double it inside the string (e.g. 'Hide ''Get Music Premium''').

### Naming & Catalog Hierarchy

The declarative keys define both the asset filename and how the app appears in release notes and the website catalog:
- **`app-name`**: Sets the human-readable display name (e.g. `YouTube`, `Instagram`, `Prime Video`).
- **`brand`**: Declares the canonical patch brand or creator identity (e.g. `ReVanced Advanced`, `Piko`, `Adobo`, `Paresh`, `Android TV`, `Morphe`).
- **`variant`**: (Optional) Declares visual or feature variations (e.g. `Nord`, `Mocha`, `MaterialYou`).
- **`sub-variant`**: (Optional) Declares packaging or installation variations (e.g. `clone`, `alt`).
- **`pkg-name`**: Sets the upstream stock application package name (e.g. `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom`), used by scrapers (APKMirror, Uptodown) and patch bytecode checkers.
- **`patched-pkg-name`**: (Optional) Declares the resulting installed package name when changed by a clone patch (e.g. `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom.clone`). Used by the website catalog and Obtainium for installation tracking. If omitted on cloned apps, the build engine automatically extracts the real package ID from the built APK's manifest using `aapt2`.

#### Direct Slug Resolution

The build engine (`utils.sh`) automatically derives filename slugs directly from your declarative configuration using clean kebab-casing:
- `brand = "ReVanced Advanced"` ➔ `revanced-advanced` (or `brand = "Anddea"` ➔ `anddea`)
- `brand = "Android TV"` ➔ `android-tv`
- `brand = "Piko"` ➔ `piko`
- `brand = "Morphe"` ➔ `morphe`
- `app-name = "YouTube Music"` ➔ `youtube-music`

Every configuration is self-contained in its TOML file with zero external lookup files.

**Output Filename Structure:**
```
${app_slug}-${brand_slug}${variant:+-$variant}${sub_variant:+-$sub_variant}-v${version}-${arch}.apk
```

Examples:
- `app-name = "YouTube"`, `brand = "ReVanced Advanced"`, `variant = "Nord"` ➔ `youtube-revanced-advanced-nord-v20.51.39-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "YouTube Music"`, `brand = "Anddea"` ➔ `youtube-music-anddea-v8.11.51-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Instagram"`, `brand = "Piko"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `instagram-piko-clone-v439.0.0.37.89-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Prime Video"`, `brand = "Android TV"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `prime-video-android-tv-clone-v3.0.354-arm-v7a.apk`
- `app-name = "TikTok"`, `brand = "Morphe"`, `sub-variant = "alt"` ➔ `tiktok-morphe-alt-v37.5.4-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Disney+"`, `brand = "Android TV"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `disney-android-tv-clone-v3.0.354-arm-v7a.apk`

## Multiple Patch Sources

You can pass multiple patch bundles to the CLI by specifying `patches-source` as a quoted list (same format as `excluded-patches`).
When using multiple sources, the CLI merges the patch bundles. However, please see the **Current Limitations** below regarding `included-patches` and `excluded-patches`.

```toml
# single-line format
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"

# multiline format
patches-source = """\
  'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' \
  'other/patches' \
  """

# If all sources are on the same host, a single string applies to all:
patches-source-host = "github"

# If sources span different hosts, provide one value per source in order:
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"

# Same rule applies to patches-version:
patches-version = "stable"                        # applies to all sources
patches-version = "'stable' 'v1.2.3'"             # per-source versions
```

> [!TIP]
> **Per-bundle patch selection**: When using multiple sources, separate patch lists 
> with `|` to control each bundle independently:
> ```toml
> patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"
> excluded-patches = "'Patch A' | 'Patch B'"    # Patch A from bundle 1, Patch B from bundle 2
> included-patches = "'' | 'Patch X'"           # nothing from bundle 1, Patch X from bundle 2
> ```
> Without `|`, the same list applies to all bundles (backward compatible).

## Xposed Modules (NPatch)

You can natively inject Xposed modules into an app using `7723mod/NPatch` directly from your config. Set the `cli-source` to the NPatch repository and the `patches-source` to the Xposed module repository.

```toml
[Discord]
cli-source = "7723mod/NPatch"                            # Use NPatch as the CLI
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "revenge-mod/revenge-xposed"            # Provide the Xposed module as the patches bundle
patches-version = "stable"
version = "auto"                                         # 'auto' safely falls back to 'latest' since modules don't list supported versions
arch = "auto"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/discord/releases/..." # Or apkmirror, etc.
```

When the script detects `npatch` in the CLI source, it bypasses ReVanced CLI arguments and executes the injection command. You can also pass extra options to NPatch using `patcher-args = "-l 2"`.

## Instafel Patcher (Instagram Alpha)

You can natively build Instagram Alpha using the Instafel Patcher engine (`instafel/p-rel`) and Patcher Core (`instafel/pc-rel`).

```toml
[instagram-instafel]
cli-source = "instafel/p-rel"                            # Use Instafel Patcher CLI
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "instafel/pc-rel"                       # Provide Instafel Patcher Core
patches-version = "stable"
included-patches = "'unlock_developer_options' 'remove_snooze_warning' 'remove_ads' 'instafel'"
```

## Morphe Bundle Passthrough

When the tool is **morphe-desktop** (`cli-source = "MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"`,
the default) and the stock download is a bundle format (`.xapk`/`.apkm`/`.apks`),
the engine keeps the vendor bundle as the cache artifact and hands it to morphe
directly instead of pre-merging it with apkeditor. Morphe merges bundles
natively, and some apps misbehave after apkeditor's rewrite+re-sign, so this
produces cleaner patched APKs and avoids caching two copies of the same app.

- **Scope**: automatic — no per-app config. Applies per build when the download
  is a bundle; plain `.apk` stocks and all other patcher tools (revanced family,
  Xposed, instafel) are untouched.
- **Cache**: the bundle is stored once as `${pkg}-${version}-all.xapk` (or
  `.apkm`/`.apks`). For `arch = all`/`auto` it goes to morphe whole; for
  `arm64-v8a`/`arm-v7a`/`x86`/`x86_64` the engine strips only the *other ABIs'*
  `config.*` members (a `zip -d`, no merge, no re-sign) and passes the trimmed
  bundle. Switching an app from `all` to `both`/`arm64-v8a` reuses the cached
  bundle rather than re-downloading.
- **Module stock**: `include-stock = merged` merges from the cached bundle on
  demand (throwaway, never cached); `split` reads the bundle directly; `disable`
  needs nothing. All three work with passthrough active.
- **Cache repo (`nullcpy/apks`)**: the bundle is uploaded as-is (it is the file
  the build used); the downloader side already accepts bundle extensions.
- **Kill switch**: set the repo variable `RVB_MORPHE_PASSTHROUGH=false`
  (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) to revert to the old
  merge-at-download behavior without a code change. Existing merged-`.apk`
  cache entries keep working for any non-morphe tool.

## Modular Configuration Directory & Dynamic Pool Routing

Configurations are organized in `configs/patches/*.toml` (e.g. `morphe.toml`, `anddea.toml`, `piko.toml`, `ajstrick81.toml`).

You do **not** need separate files for stable and beta:
- **Single-File Co-existence**: All variants and builds for a brand or patch source can reside in the same `.toml` file.
- **Top-Level Inheritance**: Keys defined at the top of the file before the first `[...]` header (such as `patches-source`, `brand`, `variant`, and `patches-version`) act as file-level defaults. Apps automatically inherit them, keeping app blocks concise and DRY.
- **Default CLI Engine**: `cli-source` defaults to `"MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"` globally and can be completely omitted unless using alternative tools like `7723mod/NPatch` or `instafel/p-rel`.
- **Dynamic Pool Routing**:
  - **Stable Only (Default)**: If neither the file-level header nor the app specifies `patches-version`, the app is automatically compiled into the **stable** build pool only.
  - **Both Pools**: Setting `patches-version = "both"` (at the top of the file or in an app block) compiles the app into **both** stable and beta pools.
  - **Beta Only**: Setting `patches-version = "beta"` routes the app exclusively to the beta (pre-release) build pool.
  - **File-Level Defaults**: Setting `patches-version = "both"` (or `"beta"`) at the top applies that channel to all apps in the file unless individually overridden.
  - **Filename Inference**: A filename with `.beta.toml` (or legacy `.dev.toml`) automatically defaults all apps in that file to beta. Renaming to `*.toml` defaults to stable unless `patches-version = "both"` is set.
  - **Disabling an App**: Set `enabled = false` to disable an app across all pools.

## Automated Patch Sources State Tracking

Patch sources and their release versions in `configs/patch_sources.json` are **100% automated**:
- The CI automatically scans all `.toml` files, discovers every active `patches-source` repository and host (`github` or `gitlab`), and checks for new stable and beta releases.
- Unreferenced or deleted patch sources are pruned automatically.
- **You do not need to manually edit `patch_sources.json`.** Simply add or update `patches-source` in your `.toml` files.

## Automatic App Version Checking

The CI workflow automatically detects when a new version of an app is released on APKMirror, Uptodown, or Archive.org.

### How it Works
1. **Version Fetching**: During the CI run, it reads all enabled apps from the `configs/patches/*.toml` configurations and queries the URLs (`github-dlurl`, `gitlab-dlurl`, `forgejo-dlurl`, `uptodown-dlurl`, `apkmirror-dlurl`, etc.).
2. **Comparison**: It checks the newly fetched versions against the currently stored versions in `configs/app_versions.json`.
3. **Triggering**: If a new version is detected, the app is added to a temporary `active_apps.json` list, and the CI is triggered to build it.
### Tracking File
App versions are permanently tracked and committed to `configs/app_versions.json`.
You can manually update this file if you need to force a specific version state, but the CI will automatically manage it during scheduled runs.

**Selective Checking:** If you only want the CI to check specific apps (instead of all enabled apps in your config), you can add `"_check_only_listed": true` to the top level of `app_versions.json`. When this is true, the script will only check for updates for the apps that already exist as keys in the file, saving time and resources.

## Release Cleanup & Catalog Architecture

Maintenance and cleanup workflows keep GitHub Releases and changelogs pruned. The
website catalog (`data.json` on `nullcpy.github.io`) is **derived, not edited**: every
release carries a `build.json` manifest and the website repo regenerates its catalog
from scratch by folding those manifests against the live releases API.

### Release Manifests (`build.json`)
- **What**: a per-release, filename-keyed JSON manifest describing every APK/module
  in that release — app identity, brand, variant, version, arch, patch sources and
  `appliedPatches`. Schema documented in `.github/scripts/build_make_manifest.py`.
- **Numbered releases**: the builder uploads one manifest per build
  (`build_make_manifest.py` → release asset `build.json`).
- **Archive releases (`stable`/`beta`)**: after each archive file upload,
  `merge_archive_manifest.sh` downloads the release's existing `build.json`, unions it
  with the new build's entries (same filename = file replaced = metadata replaced),
  drops entries whose file no longer exists in the release, and uploads the result.
  The archive therefore carries cumulative metadata for every file it contains, even
  after the originating numbered release is deleted.
- **Backfill**: `.github/scripts/backfill_manifests.py` (run with `--apply`) can
  regenerate manifests on all live releases from a healthy `data.json` (one-time
  migration tool; dry run by default).

### Website Rebuild (nullcpy.github.io repo)
`.github/workflows/rebuild-catalog.yml` runs on `repository_dispatch
(catalog-updated)` — sent fire-and-forget by `build.yml` and `cleanup.yml` — plus a
scheduled safety net. It fetches all live releases and their `build.json`, regenerates
`data.json` (schema v2) from scratch, and pushes only on material change. Deletions are
automatic: a release or asset that no longer exists simply doesn't appear. Circuit
breakers abort a rebuild (leaving `data.json` untouched) if the releases API looks
empty (< 10 releases) or the catalog shrinks beyond `MIN_RATIO` (default 0.6); `FORCE=1`
overrides. Releases without a manifest get minimal filename-derived fallback entries.

### Automated Routine Cleanup (`cleanup.yml`)
- **Numbered Releases**: Retains the latest 98 numbered releases via `ophub/delete-releases-workflows`. Keeping 98 *is* the catalog's history window — deleted releases vanish from the website, which is correct since their files are gone.
- **Archive Releases**: Retains rolling `stable` and `beta` releases, keeping up to 2 versions per asset group via `cleanup-archive-assets.py`. Pruned assets drop out of the catalog automatically at the next rebuild.
- Ends with a fire-and-forget `catalog-updated` dispatch so the website reflects deletions promptly.

### Full Clean Slate / Rebuilding from Scratch
To completely wipe all historical releases (including `stable` and `beta`):
1. In `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`, set:
   ```yaml
   releases_keep_latest: 0
   workflows_keep_day: 0
   # (omit releases_keep_keyword: stable/beta)
   ```
2. Trigger the **Cleanup** workflow via `workflow_dispatch`. All past releases, tags,
   and workflow logs are purged.
3. In the **website repo**, run Rebuild Catalog with `FORCE=1` (edit the workflow env or
   temporarily raise `MIN_RELEASES_THRESHOLD=0`) to publish an empty catalog; the
   breaker would otherwise refuse to write with < 10 live releases.
4. Subsequent CI builds author clean numbered releases, rolling archives, and fresh
   manifests; every website rebuild thereafter is derived from whatever is live.
5. **Restoring Routine Configuration**: restore `cleanup.yml` to standard retention:
   ```yaml
   releases_keep_latest: 98
   releases_keep_keyword: stable/beta
   workflows_keep_day: 0
   ```
