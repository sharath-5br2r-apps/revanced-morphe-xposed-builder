# Config

Adding another revanced app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
# or uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a patch name itself contains a single quote, double it inside the string (e.g. 'Hide ''Get Music Premium''').

## More about other options:

There exists an example below with all defaults shown and all the keys explicitly set.  
**All keys are optional** (except download urls) and are assigned to their default values if not set explicitly.

### Naming & Catalog Hierarchy

The declarative keys define both the asset filename and how the app appears in release notes and the website catalog:
- **`app-name`**: Sets the human-readable display name (e.g. `YouTube`, `Instagram`, `Prime Video`).
- **`brand`**: Declares the canonical patch brand or creator identity (e.g. `ReVanced Advanced`, `Piko`, `Adobo`, `Paresh`, `Android TV`, `Morphe`).
- **`variant`**: (Optional) Declares visual or feature variations (e.g. `Nord`, `Mocha`, `MaterialYou`).
- **`sub-variant`**: (Optional) Declares packaging or installation variations (e.g. `clone`, `alt`).
- **`pkg-name`**: Sets the upstream stock application package name (e.g. `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom`), used by scrapers (APKMirror, Uptodown) and patch bytecode checkers.
- **`patched-pkg-name`**: (Optional) Declares the resulting installed package name when changed by a clone patch (e.g. `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom.clone`). Used by the website catalog and Obtainium for installation tracking. If omitted on cloned apps, the build engine automatically extracts the real package ID from the built APK's manifest using `aapt2`.

#### Direct Slug Resolution

The build engine (`utils.sh`) automatically derives filename slugs directly from your declarative configuration using clean kebab-casing:
- `brand = "ReVanced Advanced"` ➔ `revanced-advanced` (or `brand = "Anddea"` ➔ `anddea`)
- `brand = "Android TV"` ➔ `android-tv`
- `brand = "Piko"` ➔ `piko`
- `brand = "Morphe"` ➔ `morphe`
- `app-name = "YouTube Music"` ➔ `youtube-music`

Every configuration is self-contained in its TOML file with zero external lookup files.

**Output Filename Structure:**
```
${app_slug}-${brand_slug}${variant:+-$variant}${sub_variant:+-$sub_variant}-v${version}-${arch}.apk
```

Examples:
- `app-name = "YouTube"`, `brand = "ReVanced Advanced"`, `variant = "Nord"` ➔ `youtube-revanced-advanced-nord-v20.51.39-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "YouTube Music"`, `brand = "Anddea"` ➔ `youtube-music-anddea-v8.11.51-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Instagram"`, `brand = "Piko"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `instagram-piko-clone-v439.0.0.37.89-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Prime Video"`, `brand = "Android TV"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `prime-video-android-tv-clone-v3.0.354-arm-v7a.apk`
- `app-name = "TikTok"`, `brand = "Morphe"`, `sub-variant = "alt"` ➔ `tiktok-morphe-alt-v37.5.4-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Disney+"`, `brand = "Android TV"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `disney-android-tv-clone-v3.0.354-arm-v7a.apk`

## Multiple Patch Sources

You can pass multiple patch bundles to the CLI by specifying `patches-source` as a quoted list (same format as `excluded-patches`).
When using multiple sources, the CLI merges the patch bundles. However, please see the **Current Limitations** below regarding `included-patches` and `excluded-patches`.

```toml
# single-line format
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"

# multiline format
patches-source = """\
  'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' \
  'other/patches' \
  """

# If all sources are on the same host, a single string applies to all:
patches-source-host = "github"

# If sources span different hosts, provide one value per source in order:
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"

# Same rule applies to patches-version:
patches-version = "latest"                        # applies to all sources
patches-version = "'latest' 'v1.2.3'"             # per-source versions
```

> [!TIP]
> **Per-bundle patch selection**: When using multiple sources, separate patch lists 
> with `|` to control each bundle independently:
> ```toml
> patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"
> excluded-patches = "'Patch A' | 'Patch B'"    # Patch A from bundle 1, Patch B from bundle 2
> included-patches = "'' | 'Patch X'"           # nothing from bundle 1, Patch X from bundle 2
> ```
> Without `|`, the same list applies to all bundles (backward compatible).

## Xposed Modules (NPatch / LSPatch)

You can natively inject Xposed modules into an app using `7723mod/NPatch` or `LSPatch` directly from your config. Simply set the `cli-source` to the NPatch repository and the `patches-source` to the Xposed module repository.

```toml
[Discord]
cli-source = "7723mod/NPatch"                            # Use NPatch as the CLI
cli-version = "latest"
patches-source = "revenge-mod/revenge-xposed"            # Provide the Xposed module as the patches bundle
patches-version = "latest"
version = "auto"                                         # 'auto' safely falls back to 'latest' since modules don't list supported versions
arch = "auto"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/discord/releases/..." # Or apkmirror, etc.
```

When the script detects `npatch` or `lspatch` in the CLI source, it will automatically bypass ReVanced CLI arguments and execute the correct injection command. You can also pass extra options to NPatch using `patcher-args = "-l 2"`.

## Instafel Patcher (Instagram Alpha)

You can natively build Instagram Alpha using the Instafel Patcher engine (`instafel/p-rel`) and Patcher Core (`instafel/pc-rel`).

```toml
[instagram-instafel]
cli-source = "instafel/p-rel"                            # Use Instafel Patcher CLI
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "instafel/pc-rel"                       # Provide Instafel Patcher Core
patches-version = "stable"
included-patches = "'unlock_developer_options' 'remove_snooze_warning' 'remove_ads' 'instafel'"
```

## Modular Configuration Directory & Dynamic Pool Routing

Configurations are organized in `.github/configs/patches/*.toml` (e.g. `morphe.toml`, `anddea.toml`, `piko.toml`, `ajstrick81.toml`).

You do **not** need separate files for stable and beta:
- **Single-File Co-existence**: All variants and builds for a brand or patch source can reside in the same `.toml` file.
- **Top-Level Inheritance**: Keys defined at the top of the file before the first `[...]` header (such as `patches-source`, `brand`, `variant`, and `patches-version`) act as file-level defaults. Apps automatically inherit them, keeping app blocks concise and DRY.
- **Default CLI Engine**: `cli-source` defaults to `"MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"` globally and can be completely omitted unless using alternative tools like `7723mod/NPatch` or `instafel/p-rel`.
- **Dynamic Pool Routing**:
  - **Stable Only (Default)**: If neither the file-level header nor the app specifies `patches-version`, the app is automatically compiled into the **stable** build pool only.
  - **Both Pools**: Setting `patches-version = "both"` (at the top of the file or in an app block) compiles the app into **both** stable and beta pools.
  - **Beta Only**: Setting `patches-version = "beta"` routes the app exclusively to the beta (pre-release) build pool.
  - **File-Level Defaults**: Setting `patches-version = "both"` (or `"beta"`) at the top applies that channel to all apps in the file unless individually overridden.
  - **Filename Inference**: A filename with `.beta.toml` (or legacy `.dev.toml`) automatically defaults all apps in that file to beta. Renaming to `*.toml` defaults to stable unless `patches-version = "both"` is set.
  - **Disabling an App**: Set `enabled = false` to disable an app across all pools.

## Automated Patch Sources State Tracking

Patch sources and their release versions in `.github/configs/patch_sources.json` are **100% automated**:
- The CI automatically scans all `.toml` files, discovers every active `patches-source` repository and host (`github` or `gitlab`), and checks for new stable and beta releases.
- Unreferenced or deleted patch sources are pruned automatically.
- **You do not need to manually edit `patch_sources.json`.** Simply add or update `patches-source` in your `.toml` files.

## Automatic App Version Checking

The CI workflow automatically detects when a new version of an app is released on APKMirror, Uptodown, or Archive.org.

### How it Works
1. **Version Fetching**: During the CI run, it reads all enabled apps from the `.github/configs/patches/*.toml` configurations and queries the URLs (`uptodown-dlurl`, `apkmirror-dlurl`, etc.).
2. **Comparison**: It checks the newly fetched versions against the currently stored versions in `.github/configs/app_versions.json`.
3. **Triggering**: If a new version is detected, the app is added to a temporary `active_apps.json` list, and the CI is triggered to build it.
### Tracking File
App versions are permanently tracked and committed to `.github/configs/app_versions.json`.
You can manually update this file if you need to force a specific version state, but the CI will automatically manage it during scheduled runs.

**Selective Checking:** If you only want the CI to check specific apps (instead of all enabled apps in your config), you can add `"_check_only_listed": true` to the top level of `app_versions.json`. When this is true, the script will only check for updates for the apps that already exist as keys in the file, saving time and resources.

## Release Cleanup & Catalog Synchronization

Maintenance and cleanup workflows ensure GitHub Releases, changelogs, and the website catalog remain pruned and synchronized with live metrics.

### Automated Routine Cleanup (`cleanup.yml`)
- **Numbered Releases**: Retains the latest 98 numbered releases via `ophub/delete-releases-workflows`.
- **Archive Releases**: Retains rolling `stable` and `beta` releases, keeping up to 2 versions per asset group via `cleanup-archive-assets.py`.
- **Website Catalog Sync (`sync_website_catalog.py`)**:
  - Pulls live `download_count` numbers directly from GitHub Releases API in a single bulk request (`releases?per_page=100`).
  - Updates asset download metrics and recalculates `totalDownloads` for every brand and app in `data.json`.
  - Prunes deleted builds and empty apps, and reconciles variant pointers (`latestStable`, `latestBeta`).
  - **Circuit Breaker**: Hard-aborts if GitHub API returns `< 10` releases to protect `data.json` from accidental corruption.

### Full Clean Slate / Rebuilding from Scratch
To completely wipe all historical releases (including `stable` and `beta`) and rebuild everything with clean Schema v2 naming conventions:
1. In `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`, set:
   ```yaml
   releases_keep_latest: 0
   workflows_keep_day: 0
   # (omit releases_keep_keyword: stable/beta)
   ```
2. Set `ALLOW_EMPTY_CATALOG: "true"` in the `Synchronize Website Catalog Data` step.
3. Trigger the **Cleanup** workflow via `workflow_dispatch`.
   - All past releases, tags, and workflow logs are purged.
   - `sync_website_catalog.py` resets `data.json` on `nullcpy.github.io` to `apps: []` without tripping the circuit breaker.
4. Subsequent CI builds will author clean numbered releases and rolling archives from scratch.
5. **Restoring Routine Configuration**: After the clean-slate rebuild has run, restore `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml` back to standard retention:
   ```yaml
   releases_keep_latest: 98
   releases_keep_keyword: stable/beta
   workflows_keep_day: 0
   ```
   and remove `ALLOW_EMPTY_CATALOG: "true"` (or set to `"false"`) to re-arm the circuit breaker.
